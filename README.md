The differential saliency method used in "[Understanding Finite-State Representations of Recurrent Policy Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03745)", accepted to the *Extending Explainable AI Beyond Deep Models and Classifiers* workshop at the *International Conference on Machine Learning* **(ICML)** 2020. Here, models are just being loaded and used. In order to train models, take a look at [MMN](https://github.com/koulanurag/mmn). The output is a saliency map with respect to the given input observations.
